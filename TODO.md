- document somewhere that compilation fails if there are paths with spaces. Workaround: set TMPDIR with eg withr before calling devtools::install()
- setup r-universe so we have compiled packages, esp for previous point and Windows users
- do we need zlibbioc? It only seems to cause issues while linking, both for Windows and Linux
